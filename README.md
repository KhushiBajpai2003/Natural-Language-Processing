# Natural Language Processing 
Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks covering various topics in NLP, focusing on text preprocessing, part-of-speech tagging, morphological analysis, and named entity recognition (NER) using popular Python libraries such as NLTK and spaCy.

# Contents:
# Text Preprocessing in Python using NLTK:

Explore the fundamentals of text preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization using NLTK.
# POS Tagging and Morphological Analysis:

Learn about part-of-speech tagging (POS) and morphological analysis to understand the grammatical structure of sentences.
# Natural Language Processing Toolkit (NLTK) Basics:

Get acquainted with the basics of NLTK library, a comprehensive toolkit for NLP tasks such as tokenization, POS tagging, parsing, and more.
# Name Entity Recognition and Information Extraction with spaCy:

Dive into the world of named entity recognition (NER) and information extraction using spaCy, a powerful and efficient NLP library.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python libraries: NLTK, spaCy, etc. (Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt)

# Additional Notes:
Make sure to install the necessary libraries and dependencies before running the notebooks.
